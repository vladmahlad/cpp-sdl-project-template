# C++20 SDL2 Project Template

Basic C++20 and SDL2 project template.

## Build

The project can be built with CMake using the following commands:

```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

## Warning

The SDL submodule used by this project does not link to the official SDL repository, instead it links to my personal SDL fork.
